## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] 
- [Next.js] 
- [Three.js]
- [dat.gui]

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tscientist/solar-system-threejs.git
